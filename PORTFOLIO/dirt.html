    <p>No utopias. Only the truth; communicate the narrative of materials.</p>

    <p>This statement is informed by my reading of Marianne van Hervert's <em><a href="https://dirty-design.net">Dirty Design</a></em> manifesto. </p>
    <p> She states that modern product design, "...is purposely designed to hide any traces of its origins. Its material dimensions and production methods are obscured by a glossy finish." This sentiment is applicable to contemporary design in general.</p> 
    <p>There is an onus on designers to design honestly. This responsibility appears to be largely ignored within the corporate and commerical sectors.</p>
    <p>Marketing and status make way for the complex and dirty reality of design. The physical cost of resource extraction and the waste of mass production are concealed behind the fetishised and pristine.</p>
    <p>Replace value on the crafting of things. Be comfortable with the slow and mindful. Consider the lifetime of a product, service, experience; it's potential for evolution. What we throw out continues to exist.</p>
    <p>We don't design in a hermetic seal. We live in mind-boggling complexity. Lets embrace this dirt and strive to challenge the status quo.</p>
