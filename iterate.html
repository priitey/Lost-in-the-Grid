    <p> The process is the product. Make tools that enable users to produce their own outputs.</p>

    <p>This statement is informed by my learnings within creative coding and the <em><a href="https://www.conditionaldesign.org/manifesto/">Conditional Design</a></em> manifesto by Luna Maurer, Edo Paulus, Jonathan Puckeu, and Roel Wouters.</p>
    <p>In the time of me writing this, I have come to place significant value on the design of frameworks, methodolgies and tools.</p>
    <p>Creativity exists within limitations, restrictions, rules. The formulation and engagement with designed circumstances is what I intend to practice.</p>
    <p>Creative coding lends itself well to iteration. I have come to relish unexpected failures and novel experimentation that coding affords much opportunity for.</p>
    <p>I accept that it is my responsibility to communicate a narrative from this sequence of logic and randomness. Ultimately, I want others to engage with the tools I design.</p>
