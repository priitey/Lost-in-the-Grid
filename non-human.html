    <p>This statement is informed by my reading of George Monbiot's <em><a href="https://www.penguin.com.au/books/feral-9780141975580">Feral</a></em> (2013).</p> 
    <p>How can we escape anthropromorphism? Design must contribute to the elimination of it's negative effects upon the environments we occupy.</p>
    <p>Let's remove ourselves from the centre of the world and transcend the false dichotomy of civilistaion and nature in both the physical and digital realms. From this new vantage, begin to design.</p>
    <p>Operate one's design practice as a dynamic and everchanging process. Do not divorce it from our physical reality. Design must recognise its impact on the planet and proactively contribute to the mitigation of climate change.</p>
