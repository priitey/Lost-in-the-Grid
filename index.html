            <div class="grid-item" id="grid-item-2">This tool came from a lovely, unexpected mistake. Coding offers many moments like this sandwiched between the incessant searching for a misplaced semi-colon which breaks the program. The code is based off a method of creating a grid system with code. However, it hides behind the generative motion of text and shapes. It is possible to steal a sneak peak of this grid, you just have to find the moment when all the objects align.</div>

            <div class="grid-item" id="grid-item-5">Armed with learnings from my initial exploration, an effort to visualise the grid literally was made. An expansion of the static grid systems present within the Photoshops of the world. Chuck in some dimension flexibility and generative randomness, and you have an effort to extract more fun out of interacting with the digital screen as a layout designer. Be advised: The grid breaks within this tool. Objects within it move and scale in unexpected ways.</div>

            <div class="grid-item" id="grid-item-7">Initiated from an imagining of a mobile, modulating grid system. Inspired by creative coding explorations by Mike Van Der San. This tool was in the back of my mind throughout the whole project. It was the last to be realised with code. This grid retains its structure but doesn’t skimp on modularity. With multiple modes of movement, the grid can take on a calming smoothness or shake with frenetic vibrations. Which mood do you prefer?</div>
